Analysis of 5 years of World Happiness Report using SQL, Excel, Tableau, and regression modeling

# 🌍 What Drives Global Happiness?
*A Data Analytics Project by Laura C.

## 📘 Overview
This project examines five years of global happiness data (2020–2024) to identify the factors that most significantly impact national well-being.

Using SQL, Excel, and Tableau, I investigated the impact of GDP, social support, personal freedom, and corruption on happiness scores. The final report includes visualisations, a regression model, and key insights to facilitate a data-driven understanding of well-being.

## 🔍 Questions Explored
- Who are the happiest countries and regions (2020–2024)?
- How does GDP relate to happiness?
- What role does personal freedom play in happiness?
- Can high corruption coexist with high happiness?
- Is social support a stronger indicator than economic strength?

---

## 📊 Key Results
- **Freedom matters**: +4.57 happiness per unit increase in freedom
- **Social support** shows a stronger trend than GDP in some regions
- **Corruption is not a deal-breaker**: some countries remain happy despite high perception
- **R² = 0.37** in the regression model suggests moderate explanatory power of freedom alone
